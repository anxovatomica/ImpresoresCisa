# ImpresoresCisa
Is a program based in web that monitorizes all the printers connected in the same net(CISA) to calculate its levels of ink and send email alerts when they are low(quantity and color).
Just works with the printers of the enterprise because are the only ones I configurated.
Main features:
  - Data access to diferents web pages to get information of the printers
  - Check ink levels
  - Send email when ink levels are low
